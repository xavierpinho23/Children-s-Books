# Children-s-Books
A set of applications that integrate, process, and categorize information about childrenâ€™s books extracted from an on-line source. 

XML; Java; JAXB; XML Schema; XSLT; HTML; jxc; trang.

To run this project first run selector.Selector.java and then processor.Processor.java files, a HTML page will be created also.

- The application Selector reads the XML information and produces a shorter version, also XML, based on the user preferences.
- The application Processor reorganizes the information produced by the Selector. The XML output will be organize by authors instead of books.
- The HTML viewer will convert the XML file produced in the Processor using XSLT into a HTML page.
